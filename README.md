# [Get Started With Angular 2][published url]
## Instructor: [Reginald Dawson][instructor url]


Angular 2 is the new version of the extremely popular AngularJS framework. AngularJS turned the front-end development world upside down when it was released, bringing together a number of new or recent web application development practices into a powerful and easy-to-use framework. With version 2, the Angular team has started from scratch with a completely new system. Many of the ideas behind Angular are still the same, but the API and developer experience are very different.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Reggie Dawson will get you started using the new Angular 2 framework. You'll learn how to build a simple web app from scratchâ€”starting with scaffolding and tooling configuration. You'll learn how to use the TypeScript statically-typed variation of JavaScript to create Angular 2 components, services, and directives. Along the way you'll see how to implement the fundamentals of a modern single-page app: including routing, external API access, user input and validation.

Whether you're an experienced Angular dev wanting to make the jump to this latest version, or a new developer who wants to learn to create websites with the latest technology, this course is a great starting point for learning Angular 2.
